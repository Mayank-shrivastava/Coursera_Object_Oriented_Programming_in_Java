## OOPJ = Object Oriented Programming in Java
	3rd course of the specialization
	BY University of California, San Diego
	
	Course Goal:
	Author a class in Java and explain how objects are constructed, how they store data, and how you can define their actions.
	Trace the execution of code using memory-models.
	Define the scope of variables and methods.
	Extend existing libraries to build a medium-sized project.
	Implement user interface features.
	Build and work with a class hierarchy that has multiple levels.
	Explain “is-a” and “has-a” relationships between objects.
	Author code which implements an Interface.
	Explain the difference between compile-time and run-time decisions when working with polymorphism.
	Explain the difference between event-driven programming and imperative programming.
	Use searching and sorting to design algorithms for analyzing data.
	Search for an element in a sorted and unsorted list and explain the differences.
	Explain multiple sorting techniques and performance tradeoffs.

### **Week 1**
	Motivate the use of classes and objects in programming
	Create objects and call methods on them
	Describe member variables, methods and constructors
	Explain how to overload methods in Java and why overloading methods is useful
	Describe the meaning of the keywords public and private and their effect on where variables can be accessed

### **Week 2**
	Select and effectively use Java documentation
	Generate visual maps using Java code and the Unfolding Maps libraries
	Create and draw memory models for reasoning about variable values for primitive and object data types
	Apply the basic rules for variable scope and explain how it impacts your code
	Practice tracing code using memory models and Java's rules for variable scope

### **Week 3**
	Create and manipulate Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)
	Find and effectively use Java documentation
	Use the Processing library in your programs
	Customize visual maps using Java code
	Use Java to read and parse data files
	Organize data into appropriate objects
	Describe and use the List data type and the ArrayList class
	Describe and use the Map data type

### **Week 4**
	Explain the value of inheritance as a feature in object oriented programming languages
	Use the keyword extends
	Explain the relationship between a superclass and a subclass
	Use UML Diagrams to display class hierarchies
	Explain an “is-a” relationship between classes
	Describe how Java object construction occurs from the inside out
	Use same-class and superclass constructors in class creation
	Create methods which override from a superclass
	Contrast method overloading and method overriding
